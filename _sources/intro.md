# Environmental Data Science Toolbox

This is a **prototype** version of the National Capability UK (NC-UK) Environmental Data Science Toolbox, hosted by the UK Centre for Ecology & Hydrology (UKCEH). The aim is to apply FAIR principles (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable) to a collection of data science methods that are generalizable across different environmental applications, with a focus on integrative modelling. The hope being that this will encourage cross-disciplinary use of methods, enhancing national environmental research. 

If you're interested in contributing to this project it would be great to hear from you and you can find details of how to do so via the `CONTRIBUTING.md` page in the root of the repository. ðŸŒž

The current recommended workflow for interactively engaging with the code in the methodology notebooks is to clone the {bdg-info}`Notebook Repository` linked at the top of each notebook to get access to the relevant files and then to create a virtual environment and test running different sections of the code in your favourite IDE, such as VS Code.
