# Template Notebook for Methodologies

## Introduction

- This notebook focuses on the California housing dataset, which is a classic example set used in many statistics tutorials. Various instances of the dataset exist with slight variations. Here we load an instance directly available from the sklearn package ([California Housing Dataset](https://inria.github.io/scikit-learn-mooc/python_scripts/datasets_california_housing.html)). 
- The goal is typically to create a model that predicts the median house value in a block based on predictors such as: median income; median house age; avg. rooms per household; avg. bedrooms per household; total population; avg. members of households; latitude and longitude.    
- The performance of the model is typically assessed through predictive capability and metrics such as $\text{RMSE}$ and $\text{R}^2$.
- This notebook aims to present a basic data science pipeline for predictive analysis, using linear regression and random forests.
